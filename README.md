- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is an interesting part of the journey, since I started this API have been quite difficult to understand. Even though I'm using one right now I'm not sure I'm understanding what they mean. I'm learning a ton and I just need to keep practicing in order to understand them in a deeper way. I want to create one API in order to really understand what they mean and hopefully be able to communicate clearly with people about that.

### Continued development

I didn't know how to make the advise appear once you load the page, I'm sure it is a really easy to do. But this is showing me that there are elements that I'm weak still. I need to understand how to create something like that so that I feel more comfortable working with javaScript.

I need to keep practicing everything I want to get faster so that I can make accurate predictions of how long I'm going to take with a project. I feel being able to achieve this is a big step in my learning curve and hope to learn much more!!

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.codecademy.com) - Codecademy has been incredible in my learning experience, even though I'm learning a lot I highly recommend to take other courses as complementary exercises, they explain really core concepts but it is up to you to make sure that you are practicing them in other exercises.
- [resource 2](https://www.webdevsimplified.com) - This has been one of those resources that I have been using to complement my learning and is really good to see different approaches to the same problem.
